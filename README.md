# Practical Machine Learning Course Project
Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera

## Method
Content was created with R code and markdown that was put into files in "Rmd" format and then "html" files were generated from RStudio.

## Overview
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
